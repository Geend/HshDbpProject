CREATE PRIMARY INDEX primIndex ON proj;


Compute ticket number, issue date and time for all citations where the fine amount is over 350:
SELECT count(case when fine_amount > 350 then 1 else null end) FROM `proj`;
SELECT ticket_number, issue_data, issue_time, fine_amount FROM `proj` WHERE fine_amount > 350;

Compute make and average fine amount for each car make in the database:
SELECT make, AVG(fine_amount) FROM `proj` GROUP BY make;
SELECT make Make, AVG(fine_amount) AvgFine FROM `proj` GROUP BY make ORDER BY AvgFine ASC;


Compute the number of citations per day and violation code (alternatively: compute day and violation
code which has the highest number of citations per day and violation code):
SELECT issue_date, violation_code, count(ticket_number) FROM `proj` GROUP BY issue_date, violation_code;


SELECT ticket_number, make, fine_amount FROM `proj` WHERE make = "AUDI";
